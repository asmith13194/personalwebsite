		<h1>Why am I here?</h1>
		<p>Starting a business has been a dream of mine my whole life. Through a close friend I heard of Galvanize and witnessed how much it changed his life. I hope that by completing this program I will learn the skills and steps involved to become a great web developer and reach my goal of starting a business one day. I am very excited to learn the many langueages involved in web development and can't wait to start my first day of class.</p>
